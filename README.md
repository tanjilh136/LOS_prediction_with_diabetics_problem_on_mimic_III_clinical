# LOS_prediction_with_diabetics_problem_on_mimic_III_clinical
As you might know, diabetic patients who undergo any type of surgery need more recovery time in comparison  to non-diabetic patients on equal terms. Diabetes-related peripheral artery disease can cause a reduction in blood flow  to the surgical site, causing recovery to be delayed. Furthermore, surgical wounds are more likely to become infected  in individuals with poor blood sugar control, delaying recovery even further. Combined, surgical stress raises blood  sugar levels in the body, which can lead to ketoacidosis and further aggravate the process.  Respectively we can state that diabetes can make surgical recovery more difficult, lengthen hospital stays,  and increase costs. In this research, we are going to predict the hospital length of stay of diabetic patients after cardiac  surgery using a machine learning model.
Clinical Relevance:
Overall, correctly forecasting the demand of a product or of service is precious to the planning step in any 
segment. More precisely, the service of hospitals to patients involves several resources planning, such as the number 
of professionals allocated, medicines provided, equipment, etc.
Errors in planning, on the other hand, undoubtedly cause higher and unnecessary costs, mainly due to the 
allocation of resources that will not be used. For instance, medicines overstocking, rented and not used beds, nurses 
and doctors low value-added. Furthermore, and not less important, deviations between what was planned and the 
actual spent can decrease the level of quality provided to patients.
Thus, our project aims to construct a machine learning model that predicts the LOS of diabetic patients after 
being submitted to cardiac surgery. It can significantly support management and clinical decision-making, improving 
the hospital supply chain and the quality of care to patients, diabetics or not.
