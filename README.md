As you might know, diabetic patients who undergo any type of surgery need more recovery time in comparison  to non-diabetic patients on equal terms. Diabetes-related peripheral artery disease can cause a reduction in blood flow  to the surgical site, causing recovery to be delayed. Furthermore, surgical wounds are more likely to become infected  in individuals with poor blood sugar control, delaying recovery even further. Combined, surgical stress raises blood  sugar levels in the body, which can lead to ketoacidosis and further aggravate the process.  Respectively we can state that diabetes can make surgical recovery more difficult, lengthen hospital stays,  and increase costs. In this research, we are going to predict the hospital length of stay of diabetic patients after cardiac  surgery using a machine learning model.
